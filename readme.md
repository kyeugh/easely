## some kind of static art portfolio generator
static site generation is all the rage these days.  i quite like [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), and while it's certainly usable for generating static portfolios, at its core pelican is a platform for *blog* content.  i wanted to create something that would make it easy for people with limited experience to create self-hosted art portfolios without the hassle of tinkering with more generalized site generators.

easely is currently in its infancy.  right now i'm working on creating a basic theme and template before i get to working on the nitty-gritty content generation tools.
